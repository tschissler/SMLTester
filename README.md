# ISKRA B1T SML Parser

This is a project that demonstrates how to read SML (Smart Meter Language) data from an a ISKRA B1T digital meter.

I have tested the code with my ISKRA MT631 meter. I am reading the data with an IR USB sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi.

If the code does not work with your meter, feel free to create an issue or reach out. 
If you are willing to share the data you get from your device, together we will be able to adjust the code to also work with your device.
